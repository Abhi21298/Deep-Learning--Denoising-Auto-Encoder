# Deep-Learning--Denoising-Auto-Encoder
This is an academic mini-project on creating a denoising autoencoder for text image corrupted by noise.

## Objective - 
To create an effective denoising autoencoder that retrieve images from text images completely corrupted by noise.
Display the reconstructed image. 

## Methods used - 
1) Simple Autoencoder using Dense Layers
2) Complex Autoencoder using CNN

## Metrics - 
Loss - RMSE
Optimizer - ADAM
Learning rate - 0.001 or 0.0001 (Varies according to task) 
Epochs - 25-50 (Varies according to task objective)

## Results - 
Weights and Biases are used to capture the trajectory of the loss. Images are part of the jupyter notebook
Loss achieved - 0.009
